Default language of some labels is english.

##About
This widget enables you to show your next events for the next x days (configurable).

It's similar to [Matt Kilens' Google Cal Widget](https://github.com/mattk410/gcal-widget/), but it supports multiple google calendar feeds.


##Installation
Copy the `uebersicht-widget-for-google-cal.widget` directory or the contents of the zip file into your Übersicht Widget Directory.

Then open the `uebersicht-widget-for-google-cal.js` file within that `uebersicht-widget-for-google-cal.widget` folder and setup your google calendar feed urls.

You can also setup how many days in the future should be shown, and how often it should be fetched.
